# Endpoints
Declarative HTTP APIs made easy.

## Just APIs, nothing else.
Does NOT require to import SwiftUI or Combine but suports it.

When working with tons of different APIs and integrating multiple servies or same APIs but in different apps; using different libraries and HTTP request builders. 
Sooner or later it comes to the mind that it would be great to have some kind of abstract declaration of needed APIs. Just declaration, all the rest should be done by proper libraries (implementations).

So, `Endpoints` is my attempt to build an easy to use, lightweight library, to have API declarations by easily exposed in Swift and reused in different projects with different libraries.

`Endpoints` provies API **declarations**. When the **implementation** is up to your next project, module, etc.

Key features:

* Lightweightness
* Flexibility 
* Readability 
* Extendability 
* Portability
